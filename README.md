```bash
git clone https://github.com/<org-or-user>/LocaLoco.git
cd LocaLoco
npm install
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
```

---

### 2) Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following structure:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
DB_NAME=wad2_project
DB_PORT=3306
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:your_mysql_password@localhost:3306/wad2_project

# Better Auth Configuration
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<insert>
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Google Maps API (Optional - for map features)
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<insert>
# Azure Storage (Optional - for image uploads)
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=<insert>
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME=y<insert>
```

> Never commit the `.env` file to your repository.  
> Instead, include a `.env.example` file with placeholder values.

---

### 3) Database Setup

#### MySQL Database
1. **Start MySQL Server**
   - Make sure your MySQL server is running on `localhost:3306`
   
2. **Create Database**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE wad2_project;
   ```

3. **Import Schema & Data** (if SQL dump is provided)
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p wad2_project < backend/src/database/newdummy.sql
   ```

4. Push Schema using Drizzle
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run db:push
   ```

5. **Verify Database**
   - Check that tables exist: `user`, `businesses`, `referrals`, `vouchers`, `session`, etc.
   - The database includes two triggers for auto-generating referral codes on user signup and vouchers

### 6) Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **`ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`** | Backend not running | Ensure MySQL is running, check `.env` credentials |
| **`Cannot find module`** | Missing dependencies | Run `npm install` in root AND `cd backend && npm install` |
| **`Database connection failed`** | Wrong credentials or DB not created | Verify `.env` DB settings, create `wad2_project` database |
| **`Merge conflict marker`** | Git conflicts in code files | Resolve conflicts, remove `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers |
| **`npm run dev` fails**  | Node version or port conflict | Check `node -v` ≥ 18, kill processes on ports 3000 & 5173 |
